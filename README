This simple library can help you to parse cue sheet files in simple s-expr tree 
and  get metadata (i.e. performer, title of audio work, indices and so on) 
from it.

Example:
  (with-open-file (stream "file.cue")
    (let ((tree (cue:parse-cue stream)))
      (cue:get-from-toplevel tree :title) ;; Title of an album
      (cue:get-from-track tree 2 :title) ;; Title of second (usually) track in tree
;; Returns number of seconds from beginning of stream to third track's pregap
      (cue:get-track-index-sec tree 3 :pregap)
;; Returns number of seconds from beginning of stream to beginning of third track
      (cue:get-start-time-in-seconds tree 3 :start)))

And so on. See helper-functions.lisp for more info.
