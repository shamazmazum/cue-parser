This simple library can help you to parse cue sheet files in simple s-expr tree 
and  get metadata (i.e. performer, title of audio work, indices and so on) 
from it.

Example:
  (with-open-file (stream "file.cue")
    (let* ((tree (cue:parse-cue stream))
           (track (cue:find-track ; Find track with title "Gop Stop"
                   tree
                   #'(lambda (track) (string= (cue:get-from-track track :title) "Gop Stop")))))

      (cue:get-from-toplevel tree :title)   ; Title of an album
      (cue:get-from-track track :performer) ; Performer of the found track
;; Returns number of seconds from beginning of stream to the track's  pregap
      (cue:get-track-index-sec track :pregap)))

And so on. See helper-functions.lisp for more info.
